		<p class="essay1">The government of the Philippines is struggling to handle the difficulties of its country.
		It is now even harder for them due to the occurring pandemic. A solution must be formed to help the government
		solve the social and political issues of the Philippines. Corruption is the answer to our problems. With more
		projects needed to be made, politicians will be more motivated to develop the nation as they have the opportunity
		to gain more money and public trust.
		</p>
		<p class="essay2">Generally, government projects need funding. To have enough funds, the government will avail
		loans from agencies. More funds mean more budget for the politicians to spend. Then, the burden of debt will
		pass on to future generations. Typically, this is how corruption continues to go on until the cows come home.
		</p>
		<p class="essay3">As the 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines states, “Public office is a public
		trust.” The reason why many people wanted to be public servants is that they can enrich themselves. At the same
		time, they will be able to serve the public. Although, you must be a skilled corruptor to qualify yourself for
		becoming a politician. When you get caught, you must be able to get away with clean hands.
		</p>
		<p class="essay4">Corruption has been existing for so long. It is so long that it became a tradition among
		politicians. You can quite say that it had been a part of our culture. Without corruption, public servants
		will not be motivated to fulfill government projects. Without government projects, the social and political
		issues of the Philippines will remain unsolved. Therefore, corruption should remain part of our government.
