	<p>Hello I am Gerzen Pious E. Zabala from Batch 2024. As of 2020, I am Grade 9 from section Samat.
	I don't have an interesting introduction but I do have a few things to say. My hobbies are
	playing osu! and tetris. I live in Balanga, Bataan and I was born on October 13, 2005. I struggle
	with time management since I have a bad habit of procrastination. Other than that, I can pretty
	much barely keep up with the deadlines.

	<div class="about_text2">
	<p>Regarding about the satirical essay, I picked the topic about corruption. My inspiration on
	this essay is our Philippine government. My mother is working as a government employee and that
	is how I got most of my information from. Anyways, I hope you have reached this part(well it's kinda
	short anyways). And that, I thank you for reading all the way!
